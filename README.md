## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility first CSS framewwork
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

It was really intimidating to work on this project with React and Tailwind. Keeping in mind that I have never used the framework in a project before. Setting the two frameworks was hard, and using tailwind css as opposed to vanilla css was hard. As I was used to naming my classes the applying the styles I needed in a separate CSS.

A challenge I face was in writing cusom css usign tailwind. I found a quick hack shown below which helped me in writing custom css together with Tailwindcss
