# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility first CSS framewwork
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

It was really intimidating to work on this project with React and Tailwind. Keeping in mind that I have never used the framework in a project before. Setting the two frameworks was hard, and using tailwind css as opposed to vanilla css was hard. As I was used to naming my classes the applying the styles I needed in a separate CSS.

A challenge I face was in writing cusom css usign tailwind. I found a quick hack shown below which helped me in writing custom css together with Tailwindcss 

```html
<p className="rounded-[5px]">
My Paragraph
</p>
```

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS DOCS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me understand Tailwind syntax.
